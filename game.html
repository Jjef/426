			<h2> Project Description </h2>
			<div class = "descriptiontext">
				Our project will be a switch-accessible, audio driven game. The game will be based around song-puzzles that involve rearranging shuffled song clips into the correct order. Two modes will be available: a story mode utilizing pre-chosen songs representing varying eras from history, and an arcade mode utilizing a song bank from which the user can select a song. Since the page is intended to be accessible, it will be a fairly simple (but attractive) design. For game functionality we intend to explore the webaudio API or an alternative to use with jquery/javascript. We will potentially store user accessibility preferences (such as one switch, two switch, mouse input), difficulty preferences, song preferences for the arcade mode, and progress for the story mode. 
			</div>
			<br></br>
			<div class = "descriptiontext">
				Basic functionality for both modes should be completed by the due date. We will also attempt to allow a user to submit his/her own song for the arcade version of the game. Below is a mockup for the opening page of our game.
